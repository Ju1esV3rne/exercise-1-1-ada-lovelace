# assignment-1-1-ada-lovelace

The line `# Write your program here` is a line comment, and the computer will ignore it when executing the program. Add a new line below the line comment that prints the string "Ada Lovelace" and run the program.

The output of the program should be:

```
Ada Lovelace
```

Once you've finished the exercise and see that it prints the correct string, return the exercise to Github via the submission process. After that, you can read more about [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), who was one of the first programmers.
